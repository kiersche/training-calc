# training-calc
This repository contains code for working with and teaching trainees. The overall context is a calculator scenario. This makes the code more accessible for entry-level trainees, but also allows for discussion and demonstration of more general methodologies like TDD. Fine-grained actual coding hassles can be kept out of the picture, helping focus to be kept on methological basics.
